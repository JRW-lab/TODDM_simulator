# TODDM Simulator (MATLAB, SQL)
A MySQL-MATLAB simulator for calculating error rates in OFDM, OTFS, ODDM and TODDM.

## Instructions
To use this code, you must run it in MATLAB 2024b or higher. The parallelization toolbox is used in the current implementation but can be commented "off." Additionally, the database toolbox and several others are required, both to simulate and to upload simulation results to MySQL. SQL files are included to run in order to automatially create the needed tables for MATLAB to read/write from.
