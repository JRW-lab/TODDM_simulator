function result = ambig_direct(t,f,Ts,shape,alpha,q,res)
% This function returns the result of the ambiguity function of two
% of the same shaped pulse filters, truncated to [0 q*Ts]. Supported shapes
% are "rect", "sinc" and "rrc". (alpha is only used for "rrc")
%
% Instructions:
% 1. t:         enter a time value (in seconds)
% 2. f:         enter a frequency value (in Hertz)
% 3. Ts:        enter period (in seconds)
% 4. shape:     enter shape of pulse filters ("rect"/"sinc"/"rrc")
% 5. alpha:     enter value of roll-off factor
%                   (unused if "rrc" not selected)
% 6. q:         enter number of sample periods before time-domain cutoff
% 7. res:       enter the resolution of each integration, where dt=Ts/res
%
% Output: an ambiguity value, calculated from the given t and f matrices
% Note: unlike the closed form function, this can only find values one at a
% time
